        <h3>About This Blog!</h3>
        <p>
          <span style="color: var(--fg-accent)">void</span> *<span style="color: var(--fg-alt)">self</span> is a collection of notes, experiments,
          and reflections on both personal and computational systems that interest me.
          My aim is to sit somewhere between a kernel log and a field notebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most entries will deal with programming, networking, and how things work in general.

          Additionally, since I am in university, some posts will be closer to public documentation and others showing my technical process in my personal projects.

          There’s no schedule.

        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        <p>I attended High School and earned my Associate's degree in Olympia, Washington. After earning my diplomas
          I moved to Tucson, Arizona to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, where I am now expected to graduate
          in Spring of next year.</p>
        <p>During High School, I joined an after school <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/" target="_blank">FRC</a> program,
          and found team <a href="https://www.orf4450.org/" target="_blank">4450</a>. During my two years as Safety Captain
          I was exposed to the engineering process in a competative environment, while also leading a capstone expidition to a
          partner junior robotics team to bring metal based robotics to Cairo, Egypt.</p>
